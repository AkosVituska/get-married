        <h2>Travel and accomodations</h2>
        <p>Will there be some kind of organized transfer?</p>
        <p>No, we'll just meet at the church at 13:15.</p>
        <p>Where can I park?</p>
        <p>Parking is free on the weekends in the 1st district. The         locations are close to each other so you won't need your car.</p>
        <p>How can I get home at night?</p>
        <p>The 916 bus is in service all night at the castle and it hits every major traffic hub in the city.</p>

        <h2>Food and festivities</h2>
        <p>I'd like to do some kind of surprise for you guys at the party. To whom should I talk about this?</p>
        <p>Discuss it with Abigail Smith. Just drop her an email at abigail@awesomemail.com.</p>
        <p>What should I wear? Do you have a dress code?</p>
